## Welcome My Website

I'm Sashu Prakash. I plan to graduate from the [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu/) in 2025 with wither a degree in Computer Science, or Mechanical Engineering (hopefully both actually). 

Here are the projects I'm working on:

### My notes

I've been taking notes in all my classes at UMD when it makes sense to do so. Two things have stood out to me in this process:

* The existence of the ADS Note-Takers program proves that there is a need for class notes to be readily available
* People who might miss class some days and need to catch up need the notes from other people.

So, I've decided to upload my notes to a website where anyone can easily access them if needed. The goal is to provide one link to anyone that needs to see my notes.

### Other Projects

As I keep adding project to my portfolio, I'll add their discriptions here.

### Support or Contact

Having trouble accessing my notes? Have feedback for me? Do you want to contact me about something else? My name is Sashu Prakash and I am currently a freshman at UMD. Feel free to track me down on the internet to get my contact information `:)`.
