## Welcome to My Website

I'm Sashu Prakash. I plan to graduate from the [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu/) in 2025 with either a degree in Computer Science, or Mechanical Engineering (hopefully both actually). 

Here are the projects I'm working on:

### My notes

I've been taking notes in all my classes at UMD when it makes sense to do so. Two things have stood out to me in this process:

* The existence of the ADS Note-Takers program proves that there is a need for class notes to be readily available
* People who might miss class some days and need to catch up need the notes from other people.

So, I've decided to upload my notes to a website where anyone can easily access them if needed. The goal is to provide one link to anyone that needs to see my notes.

I have not created a dedicated page for these notes since I'm short on time. For now, access my OneNote Notebooks through these links. You will have to log in using your UMD Microsoft account.

* [MATH141 Notes](https://umd0-my.sharepoint.com/:o:/g/personal/sprakash_umd_edu/EmN1goG1yRlJmwoG-5ewjXEBWUM9VbXqv1R1MLpN7za-3Q?e=Y2w3ef) | [MATH241 Notes](https://umd0-my.sharepoint.com/:o:/g/personal/sprakash_umd_edu/EqgY6ANjXXVEgORW6-bUuUcBZ6deGnscmzEK7MDoaa9fSw?e=qdMUdS)
  * For MATH141: I didn't take super good notes or anything so they're messy, but I think I wrote down everything Dr. John Quah wrote on the board. In one way or another. The [textbook](https://libgen.is/book/index.php?md5=3CA6E50A13EC9A680F3EE54A5A5A1DC5) and its [Solutions Manual](https://libgen.is/book/index.php?md5=71425BD0D08E34AC320AFFB1AD3BD22C) we use in class is available online at Libaray Genesis.
  * For MATH241: Use these notes in conjunction with Prof. Ebrehemian's Course Summary Notes, available on Canvas > Files > [Math 241 Lecture Note Summary](https://umd.instructure.com/files/66995194/download?download_frd=1). You can find what topics we covered here and on the [syllabus](https://umd.instructure.com/courses/1321101), and confer with Prof. Justin's [YouTube videos](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLV_e97dP47FE0KsQwaGYpRlQ1c2cv-eiI) for additional help. The [textbook](https://libgen.is/book/index.php?md5=3CA6E50A13EC9A680F3EE54A5A5A1DC5) and its [Solutions Manual](https://libgen.is/book/index.php?md5=71425BD0D08E34AC320AFFB1AD3BD22C) we use in class is available online at Libaray Genesis.
* [PHYS161 Notes](https://umd0-my.sharepoint.com/:o:/g/personal/sprakash_umd_edu/EkZTMWkpEe1Js7eOSMldc2kBkA3qzVMOKihYIVoq6CY05Q?e=bEI8QY)
  * My professor, Dr. Hailu Gebremeniam, sometimes clicks through the question slides too fast to get the entire question down, but he still does the entire problem and I copy it down.
* [ENES100 Notes](https://umd0-my.sharepoint.com/:o:/g/personal/sprakash_umd_edu/EjL5NvTMy9hEowUbolb3LwsBz5COjXXljbBbfxEyAFqYYA?e=fuBkvf) | [ENES102 Notes](https://umd0-my.sharepoint.com/:o:/g/personal/sprakash_umd_edu/EvuQIxPnw1NGj6Lib7pJDpkBtysg1G0G317ywwRAYZ3ogQ?e=CeWX7n)
  * For ENES100: I didn't take notes in this class because the entire class was just about making a project. Although there was instruction about mechanics, electronics, and coding, I didn't take much notes on it since it was stuff I already knew and I didn't think other people might need my notes. For help with mechanics, my ENES102 notebook covers it very well.
  * For ENES102: Dr. Bowden is an amazing teacher and the way she walks us through the problem is not replicable in notes. Try to attend her lectures, but I've written down every word, symbol, and drawing she's put on the board. The class uses the a [textbook](http://ter.ps/enes102book) which you **must purchase** from the ENGR Copy Center for $33 when class starts `:)`.
  * Also, here is my [Equation Sheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1riB6Qrc8LUXka3PQoLW5G53tEvffZFBm/view?usp=sharing) for ENES102.
* [AREC210 Lecture Annotations](https://umd0-my.sharepoint.com/:o:/g/personal/sprakash_umd_edu/EoGlnfJ3lCFGh9iYRCS-JKgBdql6owjrKEzqsq9asRMQhQ?e=xthgRD)
  * These are just annotations on top of the presentations Dr. James MacDonald presents in class. He's a great speaker, so if you're in class, try to listen to what he says even though the topics are really boring.
  * Here are the links to the four readings we will need in class: 
    * [The Fate of Food - Amanda Little](https://b-ok.cc/book/5232080/c54131)
      * And [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d6ebFmCsTSc43YAztTbXE8Eik4sC6Y9P/view?usp=sharing)'s a PDF Version (Use UMD Google Account).
    * [Tomorrowâ€™s Table - Pamela C. Ronald, Raoul W. Adamchak](https://b-ok.cc/book/3693193/e03961)
    * [A Revolution Down on the Farm - Paul K. Conkin](https://b-ok.cc/book/909142/2d841c)
    * [Rancher, farmer, fisherman - Miriam Horn](https://b-ok.cc/book/5948672/aad313).
* [CHEM135 Notes](https://umd0-my.sharepoint.com/:o:/g/personal/sprakash_umd_edu/EoO-PP1tHtNOpYFt3boAlhEBlfERuSeWrXGFSZED7xa34g?e=YOyGSd)
  * I never took actually good notes in this class. My grade suffered because of it. 
* [HESP120 Notes](https://umd0-my.sharepoint.com/:o:/g/personal/sprakash_umd_edu/Ej20kwKoW8FAmuntCt3ixX8BzQnNT1Z1qhzYiAAMRkPPtg?e=sIPdxk)
  * I didn't take proper notes until later in the semester when I realized I was gonna fail the class if I didn't start paying attention.
* [CMSC132 Notes](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Sz156Q8w2T9D3IYjOpsTQkFGHB8KTUyf?usp=sharing) | [CMSC216 Notes](https://github.com/SashuPrakash/CMSC216Notes)
  * I didn't use OneNote for these notes. I made them locally using Markdown in VSCode, so I will have to convert those to HTML and create a dedicated page or something. I'll do that when I have time possibly over winter break. I might not do it at all. 
  * Please refer to the recorded lectures (I watch them at 2x speed).
  * I've heard good things about Ekesh Kumar's [CMSC132 Notes](https://github.com/kekesh/CMSC132) and [CMSC216 Notes](https://github.com/kekesh/CMSC132)
  * My CMSC216 Notes are on GitHub, just open/download the PDFs from there or I also provide the original MD, and converted HTML, JPG, and PNG.
* [THET285 Notes](https://umd0-my.sharepoint.com/:o:/g/personal/sprakash_umd_edu/EmkV0fydWd1Oh4dyM9mD9VEBAPaalHQHSiA1dBVATAYYrA?e=YgtnEt)
  * My notes in this class are pretty much useless because I didn't take any notes. Mr. Barker was a great teacher tho so I just listened to him when he spoke with great articulation and enunciation lol.

### Photography and Videography

Over time, I've done some photography and made some YouTube videos. 
* Some of my pictures can be found at:
  * Instagram: [@sashuphoto](https://www.instagram.com/sashuphoto/) 
  * VSCO: [sashuprakash](https://vsco.co/sashuprakash/gallery).
* I've also made some YouTube videos and stuff (this is all really old work so don't expect much):
  * My First Channel: [Sashu Tech](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnJ9lDvnEGj7Rr0uxhlwGPg).
    * I quit this channel because it turned me into a meme. 
  * My Personal Channel: [Sashu Prakash](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjikAENAkSSfOy24DbdjDNA). 
    * [Climate Change Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEYwasLFX6g) shown to the Governer at the Maryland Climate Summit.
  * Random Short Vlogs Channel: [The OG Indian Ballers United](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoFsPur5ro2EguWH4JESt4w).
    * This channel was just me experimenting with my camera, video editing, color grading, and sound design.
  * Other videos:
    * Funny Video I made for my friend: [Try Not To Be Bored (S01E01)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D3E836iL20).
    * HoCo SMOB Convention Videos: I lead a team of videographers to plan, set-up, shoot, and edit the 2019 Howard County SMOB convention. I aquired equipment from my school and provided much of my own, operated the equipment during the shoot, and taught the students I lead basic video editing. The video was similar to [this one](https://vimeo.com/256990165). For some reason, I can't find the 2019 video anywhere. In 2020, one of the students that I led took over because he was the son of the HoCo faculty member who ran the SMOB Convention. I despise nepotism; I'm still salty about it. The only proof that I can find that this happened is this [article](https://www.baltimoresun.com/maryland/howard/ph-ho-cf-smob-convention-0307-story.html) where I'm cited as "one of the four videographers at the convention". Most of the credit was given tot he other kid because he was intervieiwng with the press while I was running the rest of the show.

### Other Projects

As I keep adding project to my portfolio, I'll add their discriptions here.
