## Welcome My Website

I'm Sashu Prakash. I plan to graduate from the [University of Maryland](https://umd.edu/) in 2025 with wither a degree in Computer Science, or Mechanical Engineering (hopefully both actually). 

Here are the projects I'm working on:

### My notes

I've been taking notes in all my classes at UMD when it makes sense to do so. Two things have stood out to me in this process:

* The existence of the ADS Note-Takers program proves that there is a need for class notes to be readily available
* People who might miss class some days and need to catch up need the notes from other people.

So, I've decided to upload my notes to a website where anyone can easily access them if needed. The goal is to provide one link to anyone that needs to see my notes.

I have not created a dedicated page for these notes since I'm short on time. For now, access my OneNote Notebooks through these links. You will have to log in using your UMD Microsoft account.

* [MATH141 Notes](https://umd0-my.sharepoint.com/:o:/g/personal/sprakash_umd_edu/EmN1goG1yRlJmwoG-5ewjXEBWUM9VbXqv1R1MLpN7za-3Q?e=Y2w3ef) | [MATH241 Notes](https://umd0-my.sharepoint.com/:o:/g/personal/sprakash_umd_edu/EqgY6ANjXXVEgORW6-bUuUcBZ6deGnscmzEK7MDoaa9fSw?e=qdMUdS)
* [PHYS161 Notes](https://umd0-my.sharepoint.com/:o:/g/personal/sprakash_umd_edu/EkZTMWkpEe1Js7eOSMldc2kBkA3qzVMOKihYIVoq6CY05Q?e=bEI8QY)
* [ENES100 Notes](https://umd0-my.sharepoint.com/:o:/g/personal/sprakash_umd_edu/EjL5NvTMy9hEowUbolb3LwsBz5COjXXljbBbfxEyAFqYYA?e=fuBkvf) | [ENES102 Notes](https://umd0-my.sharepoint.com/:o:/g/personal/sprakash_umd_edu/EvuQIxPnw1NGj6Lib7pJDpkBtysg1G0G317ywwRAYZ3ogQ?e=CeWX7n)
* [AREC210 Lecture Annotations](https://umd0-my.sharepoint.com/:o:/g/personal/sprakash_umd_edu/EoGlnfJ3lCFGh9iYRCS-JKgBdql6owjrKEzqsq9asRMQhQ?e=xthgRD)
* [CHEM135 Notes](https://umd0-my.sharepoint.com/:o:/g/personal/sprakash_umd_edu/EoO-PP1tHtNOpYFt3boAlhEBlfERuSeWrXGFSZED7xa34g?e=YOyGSd)
  * I never took actually good notes in this class. My grade suffered because of it. 
* [HESP120 Notes](https://umd0-my.sharepoint.com/:o:/g/personal/sprakash_umd_edu/Ej20kwKoW8FAmuntCt3ixX8BzQnNT1Z1qhzYiAAMRkPPtg?e=sIPdxk)
  * I didn't take proper notes until later in the semester when I realized I was gonna fail the class if I didn't start paying attention.
* [CMSC132 Notes](https://sashuprakash.github.io/) 
  * I didn't use OneNote for these notes. I made them locally using Markdown in VSCode, so I will have to convert those to HTML and create a dedicated page or something. I'll do that when I have time possibly over winter break. I might not do it at all. 
  * Please refer to the recorded lectures (I watch them at 2x speed).
  * I've heard good things about Ekesh Kumar's [CMSC132 Notes](https://github.com/kekesh/CMSC132)
* [THET285 Notes](https://umd0-my.sharepoint.com/:o:/g/personal/sprakash_umd_edu/EmkV0fydWd1Oh4dyM9mD9VEBAPaalHQHSiA1dBVATAYYrA?e=YgtnEt)
 * My notes in this class are pretty much useless because I didn't take any notes. Mr. Barker was a great teacher tho so I just listened to him when he spoke with great articulation and enunciation lol.

### Other Projects

As I keep adding project to my portfolio, I'll add their discriptions here.
